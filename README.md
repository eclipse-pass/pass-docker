PASS Docker is a developer-focused PASS runtime, which provides the PASS project and all of its dependent services using
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). PASS Docker provides Docker images that can be used for running PASS in different environments including
a local test instance and production.

You can find further documentation and details about PASS Docker on the full documentation site. A full list of all the
Eclipse PASS projects can also be found in the PASS Main repository README.
