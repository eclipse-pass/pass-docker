PASS Docker is a developer-focused PASS runtime, which provides the PASS project and all of its dependent services using
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). PASS Docker provides Docker images that can be used for running PASS
in different environments including a local test instance and production.

You can find further documentation and details about [PASS Docker](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org/developer-documentation/pass-docker)
on the [full documentation site](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org). A full list of all the Eclipse PASS projects can also
be found in the PASS Main repository [README](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/blob/main/README.md).
